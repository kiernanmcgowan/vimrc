dropdownmenu's vimrc
=============

A very easy script to keep .vimrc in the cloud.

deps
-----

There are a few needed packages before you can start.

```
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev build-essential vim-* git
```

install
-------

Super simple, but it does assume that all of your vim fun lives in `~/.vim`

```
git clone https://github.com/dropdownmenu/vimrc.git ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim
sh install.sh
```
